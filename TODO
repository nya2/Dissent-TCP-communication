Connections
- ConnectionManager should send a Disconnect signal when it has safely disconnected after calling CM::Disconnect
- ConnectionTable should be a value type
- ConnectionManager and maybe EL should turn reject requests for connections when closed

Transports
- Need a real networking transport

Utils
- VirtualTime should have a method that lets it be executed for a specific amount of time via QEvent mechanisms
